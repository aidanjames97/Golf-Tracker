# Golf Tracker
Golf Tracker is an app I designed and developed to track your rounds of golf. Currently the app functions as intened with the ability to add new rounds consisting of your score, total putts, worst and best putts. Courses can also be viewed from a temporary list which I intend on expaning on one I have found a suitable database of courses to source data from.
